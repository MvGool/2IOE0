Antemies is an ant colony simulation game. You start in the world with an enemy colony with the sole purpose of gathering resources to survive.
There are 2 kinds of resources, materials and food. Food will keep your ants alive and material allow expansion of your colony.

The game has a top down view which use WASD as controls to move the camera. Using the scroll wheel you can zoom in and out, the zooming is capped at certain levels. The game can be paused by pressing P or ESCAPE.

Standing on a resource will allow your gatherer ant to collect that resource and brind it back to the nest. In the meantime the player, the forager ant, can discover new resources to be collected. Try to do this as fast as possible as the enemy also has a forager and collector ant racing you to strive as the biggest colony!
