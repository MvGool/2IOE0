Keep in mind that obj models are for static models and fbx and dae can be used for both animated and static models

Ant_anim_fbx.fbx	loads as static model		loads as animated model, although shader messed up
Ant_fbx.fbx		same as above, think just same model without skeleton
antfree.fbx		again same
antmodelmilan.obj	gives null error when loading as static model
eric.dae		works as both static and animated, although shader messed up
eric.fbx		same as above but fbx model
freemodel.dae		null error when loading
freemodel2.dae		null error when loading
freemodel3.dae		null error when loading
monkey.obj		works as static model
ourantmodeldifferentstructure.dae	null error when loading
sturm.fbx		null error when loading
